# react_pinterest_clone


This project was an experiment for me to understand how React.js work along with the notorious infinite scroll to fetch new data...

In this project, you will find

-   User Login/Register (Authentication/Authorization) including SSO with JWT.
-   Dashboard to display active post made by the use
-   Mongoose -> Connecting to Atlas's endpoint
-   React's Redux/Reducers/Store
-   Boostrap 3
-   RESTful API with Express.js with protected routes
